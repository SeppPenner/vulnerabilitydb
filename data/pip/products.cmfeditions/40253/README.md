## Overview
[`products.cmfeditions`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/products.cmfeditions) is a Versioning for Plone.

The CMFEditions component 2.x in Plone 4.0.x through 4.0.9, 4.1, and 4.2 through 4.2a2 does not prevent the KwAsAttributes classes from being publishable, which allows remote attackers to access sub-objects via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-3587.
