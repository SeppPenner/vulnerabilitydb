# Overview
Affected versions of [`typo3/cms`](https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/cms) are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution.

Extbase in TYPO3 4.3.0 before 6.2.24, 7.x before 7.6.8, and 8.1.1 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted Extbase action.

## Remediation
Upgrade `typo3/cms` to version 6.2.24, 7.6.8, 8.1.1 or higher.
