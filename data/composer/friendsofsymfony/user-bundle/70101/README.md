# Overview
Affected versions of [`friendsofsymfony/user-bundle`](https://packagist.org/packages/friendsofsymfony/user-bundle) are vulnerable to Insufficient Randomness.

The usage of `base_convert` looses precision for large inputs, which causes the entropy of tokens generated by FOSUserBundle for the email confirmation and password resetting is lost. This makes these tokens much less random than they are expected to be, and so not cryptographically safe.

## Remediation
Upgrade `friendsofsymfony/user-bundle` to version 1.3.5, 1.3.0 or higher.
