# Overview
Affected versions of [`drupal/drupal`](https://packagist.org/packages/drupal/drupal) are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS).

The transliterate mechanism in Drupal 8.x before 8.2.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted URL.

## Remediation
Upgrade `drupal/drupal` to version 8.2.3 or higher.
