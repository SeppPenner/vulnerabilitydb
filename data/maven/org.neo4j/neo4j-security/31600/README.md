## Overview
[`org.neo4j:neo4j-security`](https://neo4j.org) is the worldâ€™s leading Graph Database. It is a high performance graph store with all the features expected of a mature and robust database, like a friendly query language and ACID transactions.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Timing Attack due to using the `Arrays.equals` to validate the password, which is vulnerable to a brute force attacks by malicious users.

## Remediation
Upgrade `neo4j-security` to version 3.0.12 or higher.
