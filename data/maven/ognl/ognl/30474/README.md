## Overview
[`ognl:ognl`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22ognl%22)
Apache Struts 2.0.0 through 2.3.24.1 does not properly cache method references when used with OGNL before 3.0.12, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (block access to a web site) via unspecified vectors.
