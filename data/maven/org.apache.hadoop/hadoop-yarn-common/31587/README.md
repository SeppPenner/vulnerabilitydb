## Overview
[`org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-common`](https://hadoop.apache.org) is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

## Remediation
Upgrade `org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-common` to version 2.7.3 or higher.
