## Overview
[`org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-mapreduce-client-core`](https://hadoop.apache.org) is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.

Apache Hadoop 2.6.x encrypts intermediate data generated by a MapReduce job and stores it along with the encryption key in a credentials file on disk when the Intermediate data encryption feature is enabled, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the file.
