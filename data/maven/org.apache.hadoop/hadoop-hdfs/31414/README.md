[`org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-hdfs`](https://hadoop.apache.org) is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.

The HDFS web UI in Apache Hadoop before 2.7.0 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack through an unescaped query parameter.
