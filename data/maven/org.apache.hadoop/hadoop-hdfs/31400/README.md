## Overview
[`org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-hdfs`](https://hadoop.apache.org) is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.

HDFS clients interact with a servlet on the DataNode to browse the HDFS namespace. The NameNode is provided as a query parameter that is not validated in Apache Hadoop before 2.7.0.
