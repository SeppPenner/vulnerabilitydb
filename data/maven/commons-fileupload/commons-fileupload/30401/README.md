The Apache Commons FileUpload library contains a Java Object that, upon deserialization, can be manipulated to write or copy files in arbitrary locations. If integrated with [`ysoserial`](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial), it is possible to upload and execute binaries in a single deserialization call.
