## Overview
[`activemq:activemq-core`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22activemq-core%22) is an open source message broker and JMS 1.1 provider.
Apache ActiveMQ before 5.6.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (file-descriptor exhaustion and broker crash or hang) by sending many openwire failover:tcp:// connection requests.
