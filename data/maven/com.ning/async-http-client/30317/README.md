## Overview
[`com.ning:async-http-client`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22async-http-client%22)
Async Http Client (aka AHC or async-http-client) before 1.9.0 skips X.509 certificate verification unless both a keyStore location and a trustStore location are explicitly set, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof HTTPS servers by presenting an arbitrary certificate during use of a typical AHC configuration, as demonstrated by a configuration that does not send client certificates.
