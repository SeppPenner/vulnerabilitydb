## Overview
[`org.apache.hive:hive-service`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22hive-service%22)
The LDAP implementation in HiveServer2 in Apache Hive before 1.0.1 and 1.1.x before 1.1.1, as used in IBM InfoSphere BigInsights 3.0, 3.0.0.1, and 3.0.0.2 and other products, mishandles simple unauthenticated and anonymous bind configurations, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted LDAP request.
