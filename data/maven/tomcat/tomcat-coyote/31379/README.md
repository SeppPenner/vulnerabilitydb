## Overview
[`tomcat:tomcat-coyote`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22tomcat-coyote%22)
Certain AJP protocol connector implementations in Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 through 7.0.20, 6.0.0 through 6.0.33, 5.5.0 through 5.5.33, and possibly other versions allow remote attackers to spoof AJP requests, bypass authentication, and obtain sensitive information by causing the connector to interpret a request body as a new request.
