## Overview
[`net.fckeditor:java-core`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22java-core%22) enables the FCKeditor to be used in a Servlet/J2EE environment. It provides JSP tags for creating a FCKeditor instance and a Servlet handling server-side user files and folders.

FCKeditor.Java 2.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a malformed request parameter that contains "ctrl" characters.
