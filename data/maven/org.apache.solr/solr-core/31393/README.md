## Overview
[`org.apache.solr:solr-core`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22solr-core%22)
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal attacks. The Index Replication feature supports an HTTP API, but does not validate the `file_name` parameter, which is supplied by the user. An attacker can craft a special request and read any file on the server.
