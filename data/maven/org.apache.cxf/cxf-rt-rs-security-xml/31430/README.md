## Overview
[`org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-rs-security-xml`](https://http://cxf.apache.org/) is an open source services framework.

JAX-RS XML Security streaming clients in Apache CXF before 3.1.11 and 3.0.13 do not validate that the service response was signed or encrypted, which allows remote attackers to spoof servers.
