[`org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-ws-security`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22cxf-rt-ws-security%22)
Apache CXF's STSClient before 3.1.11 and 3.0.13 uses a flawed way of caching tokens that are associated with delegation tokens, which means that an attacker could craft a token which would return an identifer corresponding to a cached token for another user.
