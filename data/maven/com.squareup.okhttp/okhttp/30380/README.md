[`com.squareup.okhttp:okhttp`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22okhttp%22)
OkHttp before 2.7.4 and 3.x before 3.1.2 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass certificate pinning by sending a certificate chain with a certificate from a non-pinned trusted CA and the pinned certificate.
