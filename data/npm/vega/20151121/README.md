## Overview
[`vega`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vega) is The Vega visualization grammar tool.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). There is no validation that the requested group is an existing group before calling its scale method and using the returned scale.

You can read more about `Cross-site Scripting (XSS)` on our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/marked-xss-vulnerability/).

## Remediation
Upgrade `vega` to version 2.4.0 or higher.
