## Overview
[`PivotTable.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pivottable) is a Javascript Pivot Table library with drag-and-drop functionality built on top of jQuery/jQueryUI.

Due to a change from text to html functions in how JSON elements are rendered, a Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was introduced in version 1.4.0.  This vulnerability remained in place until version 2.0.0.
