## Overview
[`squire-rte`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/squire-rte) is an HTML5 rich text editor, which provides powerful cross-browser normalization, while being supremely lightweight and flexible.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
You can read more about `Cross-site Scripting (XSS)` on our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/marked-xss-vulnerability/).

## Remediation
Upgrade `squire-rte` to version 1.6.0 or higher.
