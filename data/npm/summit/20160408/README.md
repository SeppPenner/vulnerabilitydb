## Overview
[`summit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/summit) is a node web framework.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command Execution via the `eval()` function in the PouchDB driver. Node.js provides the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate strings into Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload instead of a valid collection name to inject arbitrary commands.

## Remediation
There is no fix version for `summit`.
