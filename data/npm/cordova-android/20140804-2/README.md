## Overview
[`cordova-android`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-android) is an Android application library that allows for Cordova-based projects to be built for the Android Platform.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Information Exposure. This allows remote attackers to open and send data to arbitrary applications via a URL with a crafted URI scheme for an Android intent.

## Remediation
Upgrade `cordova-android` to version 3.5.1 or higher.
