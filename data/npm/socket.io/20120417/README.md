## Overview
[`socket.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io) is a node.js realtime framework server.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient user input validation in the `jsonp-polling` function. Attackers may exploit this by injecting arbitrary script into the browser.

You can read more about `Cross-site Scripting (XSS)` on our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/marked-xss-vulnerability/).

## Remediation
Upgrade `socket.io` to version 0.9.6 or higher.
