## Overview
[`appium-chromedriver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appium-chromedriver) is a Node.js wrapper around chromedriver.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.

## Remediation
Upgrade `appium-chromedriver` to version 2.9.4 or higher.
