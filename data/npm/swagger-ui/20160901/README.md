## Overview
[`swagger-ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui) is a dependency-free collection of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger-compliant API.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to not escaping html script tags.
You can read more about `Cross-site Scripting (XSS)` on our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/marked-xss-vulnerability/).

## Remediation
Upgrade `swagger-ui` to version 2.2.3 or higher.
