## Overview
[`protojs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protojs) is a ES5-compatible object manipulation library for node and modern browsers.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Injection due to unsafe use of the `eval()` function. Node.js provides the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate strings into Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload to inject arbitrary commands.

## Remediation
Upgrade `protojs` to version 1.0.6 or higher.
