## Overview
FuelUX is a library for extending Twitter Bootstrap with additional lightweight JavaScript controls.

There exists a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Pillbox feature of FuelUX.  By supplying a script as a value for a new pillbox, it is possible to cause arbitrary script execution.  

This advisory is being released before a public patched version is available because the issue was reported publicly on Github.
