## Overview
[`FuelUX`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuelux) is a library for extending Twitter Bootstrap with additional lightweight JavaScript controls.
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks by sending a script in a new pillbox, allowing attackers to execute malicious code.
