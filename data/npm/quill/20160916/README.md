## Overview
[`quill`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill) is powerful, rich text editor.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to not sanitizing user input when in the `pasteHTML()` function. The function was renamed, deprecated and was set to be removed in version `2.0.0`.

```js
var quill = new Quill('#editor', {
  theme: 'snow'
});

quill.pasteHTML('<img src=// onerror="alert(\'Not Found!\')">');
```

## Remediation
Upgrade `quill` to version 1.0.4 or higher.
