## Overview
[`kmc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kmc) is a NodeJS-based KISSY module packaging tool that is currently available for KISSY 1.2+ code package.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Injection due to unsafe use of the `eval()` function. Node.js provides the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate strings into Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload to inject arbitrary commands.

## Remediation
There is no fix version for `kmc`.
