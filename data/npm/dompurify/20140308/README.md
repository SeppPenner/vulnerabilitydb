## Overview
[`dompurify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify) is a DOM-only XSS sanitizer for HTML, MathML and SVG.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and DOM Clobbering due to Insecure Defaults. The default configuration allowed DOM Clobbering when used by a sanitized website. The default was changed to pevent such situations.

You can read more about `Insecure Defaults` on our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/mongodb-hack-and-secure-defaults/).

## Remediation
Upgrade `dompurify` to version 0.3 or higher.
