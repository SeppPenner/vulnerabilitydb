## Overview
`discordi.js` is a malicious package that uses [typosquatting](http://incolumitas.com/2016/06/08/typosquatting-package-managers/) to bait unknowing users to install them.
Packages like this, which carry similar names to an original package, offer all the functionality of their original, but they also include a code snippet that sends your login tokens to pastebin.

## Remediation
Avoid usage of this package altogether.
