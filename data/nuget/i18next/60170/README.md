## Overview
[`i18next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18next) is i18next internationalization framework.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to the interpolation resolution code in `translate.js` loops over each key in the dictionary and applies replacements one at a time. Along with the unescaped suffix feature in `i18next`, may allow attackers to use the name of another key in the dictionary to leverage themselves to inject code into the browser.

## Remediation
Upgrade `i18next` to version 1.10.3 or higher.
