## Overview
[`nes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nes) adds native WebSocket support to [`hapi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hapi)-based application servers.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. An attacker may craft an invalid cookie header, causing the node server to crash.

**Note:** This issue occurs only when websocket authentication is set to `cookie`.

## Remediation
Upgrade `nes` to version 6.4.1 or higher.
