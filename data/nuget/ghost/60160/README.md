## Overview
[`ghost`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ghost) is a blogging platform.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass. An authenticated user can spoof an `HTTP GET` request with any username to access any other usersâ€™ drafts. This is due to the user parameter  not being validated upon the request.

## Remediation
Upgrade `ghost` to version 0.5.9 or higher.
