## Overview
[`react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) is React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces..
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to the `createElement` method not validating the object, allowing a malicious user to pass a specially crafted JSON object and renders them as an element.

## Remediation
Upgrade `react` to version 0.14.0 or higher.
