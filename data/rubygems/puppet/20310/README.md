## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Package Installation. During package installation for Mac OS X, A predictable filename is used in the `/tmp` folder. It is possible for an attacker to await this filename and create a symlink to overwrite arbitrary files or instal arbitrary packages.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.6.15, 2.7.13 or higher.
