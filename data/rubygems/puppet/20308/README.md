## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Group Privilege Escalation. When executing commands as a different user, Puppet leaves the forked process with Puppet's own group permissions. This may allow untrusted code executed by a Puppet exec resource to be given unexpectedly high permissions.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.6.14, 2.7.11 or higher.
