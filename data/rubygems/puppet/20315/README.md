## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Access on the puppet master. If an attacker has a valid SSL certificate and private key, they could construct an HTTP GET request to return the contents of an arbitrary file on the puppet master, leading to information leakage.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.6.17, 2.7.18 or higher.
