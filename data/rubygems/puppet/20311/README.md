## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read Access. A malicious user with an authorized SSL key and can create symlinks on the puppet master, may thus read any file that the puppet master has access to. This is because a design flaw in puppet, when issuing a REST request for a file from a remote filebucket, it can override the puppet masterâ€™s defined location for filebucket storage.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.6.15, 2.7.13 or higher.
