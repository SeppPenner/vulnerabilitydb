## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Information Disclosure due to Insecure Defaults. By default, `auth.conf` allows any authenticated node to submit a report for any other node, which may lead to information disclosure.

For more information on Insecure defaults, see our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/mongodb-hack-and-secure-defaults/).
## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.6.18, 2.7.21, 3.1.1 or higher.
