## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution when using the default configuration or when enabling `puppet kick`. An authenticated agent could craft an HTTP PUT request to run arbitrary code on the master.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.6.18 or higher.
