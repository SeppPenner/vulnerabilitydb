## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. When in `edit` mode, Puppet resources use an extremely predictable file name. An Attacker may be able to trick the user into editing the files and running them with a symlink.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.6.11, 2.7.5 or higher.
