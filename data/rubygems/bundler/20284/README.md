## Overview

[`bundler`](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler) is a dependencies manager.
Affected versions of this gem use the `FileUtils.rm_rf` function to delete the Bundler tmp folder. This method is vulnerable when:
- One of parent directories or removing directory tree are world writable (including /tmp, whose permission is 1777),
- The current process has root privileges.
- The system has symbolic link.
The fix is to use `FileUtils.remove_entry_secure`. See the [Ruby Docs](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/fileutils/rdoc/FileUtils.html#method-c-remove_entry_secure) for more information.
