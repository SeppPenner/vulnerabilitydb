## Overview
[`nokogiri`](https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri) (é‹¸) is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser, with the ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Out of Bounds Memory Write. Nokogiri bundles  the `libxslt` library, which is vulnerable in versions below 3. The `xsltAddTextString` function in `transform.c` lacked a check for integer overflow during a size calculation, which allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory write via a crafted HTML page.

## Remediation
Upgrade `nokogiri` to version 1.7.2 or higher.
