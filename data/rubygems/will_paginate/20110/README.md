## Overview

[`will_paginate`](https://rubygems.org/gems/will_paginate) provides a simple API for performing paginated queries.

Affected versions are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack×“. This flaw exists because the application does not validate certain unspecified input related to generated pagination links before returning it to the user. This may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a users browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.
