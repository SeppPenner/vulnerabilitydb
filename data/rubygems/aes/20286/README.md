## Overview
[`aes`](https://rubygems.org/gems/aes) is an AES encrypt/decrypt gem built on top of OpenSSL.
Affected versions of this gem do not properly encrypt messages due to using the ruby `hex` function. `hex` converts hexadecimal strings into an integer and if it fails, zero is returned.

```rb
'10'.hex  #=> 16
'ff'.hex  #=> 255
# zero is returned on error:
'foobar'.hex  #=> 0
```

Any string that doesn't have a hexadecimal sequence (e.g. `ff` or `13`) will be transformed into an array of 32 zeros, making it possible to decrypt messages with almost any key.

## Remediation  
As of Jan. 18th there is still no fixed version, but a PR was created.
