# Snyk Vulnerability Database

This is the vulnerability database used by [Snyk](https://github.com/Snyk/snyk), a tool that helps you find and fix known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, both ad hoc and as part of your CI (Build) system.


This github repository is synced once a month, and does not contain the most up to date vulnerability information. Please refer to [Snyk's Vulnerability Database](https://snyk.io/vuln/) for up to date information.
